## Codebase

### The stack

We run on a Rails backend with mostly vanilla JavaScript on the front end. 

### Engineering standards

#### Style guide

This project follows [thoughtbot's Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/blob/master/style/ruby/.rubocop.yml), using [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) along with [Rubocop-Rspec](https://github.com/backus/rubocop-rspec) as the code analyzer. If you have Rubocop installed with your text editor of choice, you should be up and running.

## Getting Started

This section provides a high-level requirement & quick start guide.

### Prerequisites

- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/): we recommend using [rvm](https://rvm.io/) to install the Ruby version listed on the badge.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) 9.4 or higher.
- [Webpacker](https://github.com/rails/webpacker)
  - [YARN](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)
  - [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### Standard Installation

0.  Make sure all the prerequisites are installed.
1.  Fork solve_it repository, ie. https://github.com/alexmalus/solve_it/fork
2.  Clone your forked repository, ie. `git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/solve_it.git`
3.0.  `gem install foreman`
3.1.  `bundle exec rails webpacker:install`
4.  Setup your database
    - Create `config/database.yml` by copying from the provided template (i.e. `cp config/database.yml.sample config/database.yml`)
    - Update the `config/database.yml` file if needed.
5.  Set up your environment variables/secrets
    - Take a look at `.env.example`. This file lists all the `ENV` variables we use and provides a fake default for any missing keys.
    - You do not need "real" keys for basic development. Some features require certain keys, so you may be able to add them as you go.
6.  Run `bin/setup`
7.  That's it! Run `bin/rails server` to start the application and head to `http://localhost:3000/`

### Docker Installation

TODO

#### Starting the application

We're mostly a Rails app, with a bit of Webpack sprinkled in. **For most cases, simply running `bin/rails server` will do.** If you're working with Webpack though, you'll need to run the following:

- Run **`bin/startup`** to start the server, Webpack, and our job runner `delayed_job`. `bin/startup` runs `foreman start -f Procfile.dev` under the hood.
- `alias start="bin/startup"` makes this even faster. ðŸ˜Š
- If you're using **`pry`** for debugging in Rails, note that using `foreman` and `pry` together works, but it's not as clean as `bin/rails server`.

Here are some singleton commands you may need, usually in a separate instance/tab of your shell.

- Running the job server (if using `bin/rails server`) -- this is mostly for notifications and emails: **`bin/rails jobs:work`**
- Clearing jobs (in case you don't want to wait for the backlog of jobs): **`bin/rails jobs:clear`**
